      <p>
        After a little over 6 months, bincode 1.3 is finally here! This version is a big milestone. It brings many new
        features and bugfixes, as well as introducing new maintainers and a roadmap.
      </p>

        <h2>What is Bincode</h2>
        <p>
          Bincode is a compact serialization library for Rust. It uses a zero-fluff encoding scheme where encoded
          objects
          will be the same size or smaller than what they take up in memory.

        <h2>New Maintainer</h2>
        <p>For those of you who don't know, Bincode has existed since before Rust hit 1.0. Over its existance it has had
          multiple maintainers. Ty Overby, David Tolnay, and Josh Matthews to name a few.
          In the last year, development speed of Bincode has slowed down. It met most of its users' needs and developer
          mindshare shifted elsewhere to projects that were changing faster and had more
          room for experimentation.</p>
        <p>
          The consequence of this is that issues on Bincode began to pile up. Even though most users' needs were met,
          there were still some requests that required new feature work as well as time
          investigating how the features would fit into the overall design of bincode. There were also some areas of
          technical debt that could be cleaned up to improve the safety and speed of the
          library overall.
        </p>
        <p>A few months ago I got in contact with Ty and Josh to ask them if they would be interested in tranferring
          maintainership. I was a previous contributor to the library, having helped migrate it
          through the massive breakage of serde 0.9. After a short discussion it was decided that I would take over the
          maintinence of bincode.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
        <p>In the coming months I have a few overarching plans for what to do with bincode. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add `no-std` support <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/issues/265">#265</a></li>
          <li>Write a specification for the format <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/issues/221">#221</a></li>
          <li>Create implementations in other languages <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/issues/266">#266</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.3 is the first step along that path. This release contains bugfixes and some of the most requested
          features.
        </p>

        <h2>Release Notes</h2>
        <h3>What's New?</h3>
        <p>1.3 adds three big features to bincode: constructable serializers/deserializers, a new config system that's
          even more performant than the last, and varint support.</p>
        <h4>New Config System <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/pull/310">#310</a></h4>
        <p>This feature is a mostly technical one that won't affect most typical users of bincode. Bincode has a 0-cost
          configuration system. The config is expressed in the type system which removes any
          runtime branching needed. This makes configuration performant. Previously you couldn't access these config
          types
          directly. Instead configuration was constructed through an intermediate object that would
          create the actual config through a massive match statement at runtime. This meant that there was a slight
          penalty every time you ran bincode. The new config system allows the user access to the internal
          config types directly, removing the need for a large match statement and improving performance (if only
          slightly). The main advantage of exposing these types is that it allows the internal config to be
          stored, which leads into the next big feature.</p>
        <h4>Constructable Serializers/Deserializers <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/pull/310">#310</a></h4>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Being able to create an instance of the Serializer/Deserializer types directly is an important feature for
          interoperability. Libraries like `erased-serde` need access to a `Serializer` in
          order to work correctly. Bincode didn't expose the Serializer/Deserializer structs before since it was thought
          that exposing them would lock us out of adding new configuration choices and options.
          With the addition of the new config system there is no longer that risk, so the Serializer/Deserializer can be
          exposed to users!
        </p>
        <h4>Varint Support <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/pull/306">#306</a></h4>
        </h4>
        <p>Varint support has been a long requested feature of bincode. Previously, enum discriminants and slice lengths
          were stored as u32 and u64 respectively. This was wasteful for most objects since it is
          very uncommon to have an enum with millions of discriminants or a slice with billions of entries. Varint is a
          new config option for bincode that will store all values under 250 in a single byte, saving
          a lot of space in the most common cases.</p>
        <h3>What's Fixed?</h3>
        <h4>UB while deserializing <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/pull/309">#309</a></h4>
        </h4>
        <p>There was a well known UB bug in bincode that could be triggered by safe code. This is due to the fact that
          Rust doesn't have a good way to read into uninitialized buffers (see the linked bug for more info).
          The fix ended up impacting performance slightly, but since serialization libraries are often the source of
          security issues in other languages, the fix was judged to be worth the performance hit.</p>
        <h4>Poor Codegen When Deserializing From Slices <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode/pull/308">#308</a>
        </h4>
        </h4>
        <p>The slice deserialization code was generating suboptimal assembly with a lot of unnecessary function calls. A
          small change was made to allow the optimizer to work more effectively.</p>
        <h2>Closing</h2>
        <p>Again, thank you to all those who contributed to 1.3, I could not have done it without you. Thanks to Ty and
          Josh, for trusting me with such an important project. I can't wait to see where bincode goes
          in the future.</p>
